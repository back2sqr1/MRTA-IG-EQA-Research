#Emobied-Question-Answering 

Main idea: Question Answering (QA) + Manipulation

Core concepts - The robot is tasked with finding an answer to a question by actively interacting with the environment via manipulation 

- Lots of imitation learning
- Question: We have a more direct approach (you aren't trying to build a model)
- Goal: Generate manipulation actions which guide the manipulator to explore the tabletop
