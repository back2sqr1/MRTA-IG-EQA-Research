Goal: I want to ask robots questions and have them go out and probe the information from the environment

What the paper does: Presents a method that a robot system (Multi-robot) can efficiently answer questions on the basis of reasoning about observations that they made


Problem Characteristics:
- Robot-agnostic

Core ideas:
- Separate "what is known" and "how it is learned"
- Leverage informational overlap between multiple simultaneous queries
- Tries to illustrate best plan quality
- Historical context: STRIPS system - resolution theorem prover to answer questions of particular models
- "What if instead of answering questions about models of the world, we form plans whose purpose is to answer questions about the world itself?" -dumb dumb
