Studies sufficient observation and work spaces for supervisors

(wtf does that mean)

Notes:
- Uses finite state automata to model a DEDS (discrete-event dynamical system)
- Supervisor - a feedback system that observes a generated trace of events
	- Disables a subset of controllable events
- Minimize collection of sensors (supervisors in a workspace to solve a problem)

- I don't understand
