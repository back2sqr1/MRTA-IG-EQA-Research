Goals:
- Proposes a method for automatically designing sensors from the specification of a robot's task, actions, and uncertainty


Core Ideas:
- Generate a strategy through a back chaining planner assumes perfect sensing
- This indirectly specifies a sensor 
- The requirements of the sensor are minimized
