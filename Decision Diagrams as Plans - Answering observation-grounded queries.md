Characteristics of the problem: 
- A robot answers questions about its environment
- Questions are related to places 
- Questions involve conditional or contingent relationships between properties
- The system's state is partially observable
- Elements can be fully known or only within certain locations ([LOMDP](Locally%20Observable%20Markov%20Decision%20Processes))
- 


Main Point:
- We can exploit deducible information 
- The information of the world is in a concise representation via Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
- Exploit str



Core Ideas: 
- We ask robots questions rather than telling them what to do
- Data acquisition exists in [information path planning](Nonmyopic%20Adaptive%20Informative%20Path%20Planning%20for%20Multiple%20Robots) and [information gathering](Sampling-based%20otion%20Planning%20for%20Robotic%20Information%20Gathering) - They are good at getting large quantities of data
-  Rather than useful aggregated statistical analysis of data - let's get the finer relationships directly from the world
- 


Questions for Shell:
- "Such methods may be too indiscriminate for those needs" - pg1 - wth does that mean


Extra stuff:
* Papers that involve partial information

	* [[Belief space planning assuming maximum likelihood observations]]
