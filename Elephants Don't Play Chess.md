## Abstract
- Traditional approaches emphasize the manipulation of symbols
- Emphasizing ongoing physical interaction with the environment (primary source of constraint on designing intelligent systems)

passé - No longer current or in fashion (out-of-date) - Skinny jeans are passé

Issue: No one is sure where to go improve symbolic manipulation of ungrounded representations

- in the middle of an AI winter

Main idea: The symbol system hypothesis is fundamentally flawed - A physical symbol system such as a digital computer has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action. If we provide computers with appropriate symbol-processing programs, it can solve any problem

- Symbols are tokens that understand things - we manipulate these symbols through formal rules
- This manipulation produces intelligent behavior

**AN Alternate view**
- Brooks calls it nouvelle AI - derived from "situated activity," meaning behavior arises from a system being embedded in
- Based on the physical grounding hypothesis
	- Symbols only have meaning if they are grounded in the agent's physical interaction in the real world

This is different to the methodology for building intelligent systems where intelligence is decomposed into information processing modules of which determine system behavior.

The new methodology bases it decomposition of intelligence into individual behavior generating modules - whose coexistence and co-operation let more complex behaviors emerge
- So each module has its own behavior
- Combinations of behavior let more complex interactions

In classical AI - it is required to combine modules to get any behavior
- Improvement of competence is improving the functional modules

epistemological - Pertaining to knowing or mental activity

Brooks takes importance on what the symbols could mean - they might not be direct entities in the world

Modal Logic - is a type of formal logic that extends classical - including necessity, possibility, knowledge and obligation.
